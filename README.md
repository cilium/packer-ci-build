This is the Vagrant image used for running Cilium's integration tests.
It contains a variety of dependencies Cilium needs, like Kubernetes, Docker,
a Docker registry, etcd, and more.

This was ported from https://github.com/eloycoto/cilium_basebox, which was
created by @eloycoto as part of his work contributing to Cilium.
